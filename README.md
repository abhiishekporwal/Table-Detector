# Table-Detector
Automatically detect and localise table(s) in an image.

I have prepared a Demo file "TableDet.ipynb" which contains my approach to solve this problem. I had used google colab platform. 

To run the TableDet.ipynb file. Make sure you are using colab notebook.

    • Run cells of the given file by using shift+enter or ctrl+enter.
    • After loading of model, upload all the images provided in samples_images folder or you can use your own images to input_img. 
      You can upload as many images. This will take sometime.
    • After uploading your images, run all the remaining cells.
Checkout our demo notebook for loading checkpoints
